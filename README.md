# Spam-Mail-Detection

Spam Mail Detection Project

Description:

This project aims to develop a spam mail detection system using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) based on their content and characteristics. By accurately identifying spam emails, users can better manage their inbox and protect themselves from phishing attempts, malware, and other malicious activities.

Features:

Machine Learning Algorithms: The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest to classify emails.

Feature Extraction: Different features are extracted from the email content, including word frequencies, presence of specific keywords, and metadata such as sender information.

Training and Testing: The system is trained on labeled datasets containing examples of both spam and non-spam emails. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated using cross-validation and testing on separate validation sets.

Model Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the performance of the trained models.

Dependencies:

Python 3.x,
NumPy,
Pandas,
Scikit-learn,
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit),
Any additional libraries required for specific machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest)
